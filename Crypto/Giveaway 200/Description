Hey! We at Xiomara would love to giveaway the flag to you. But, we can't now, because someone just stole it from us and tried sending it to our rival, Jack. Our super strong web guy here came to the rescue and intercepted it on the way, but found that it was RSA encrypted! You are our crypto guy now. So, decrypt the message and as we promised, the flag is yours!

If it helps you, you can connect to xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx to know about Jack
