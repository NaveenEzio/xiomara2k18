# xiomara flag generator

### Vulnerability: command injection


#### Problem statement : xiomara dosent generate flag anymore. Can you get one?



#### Note to server admin: 

* Only cat and string command should work. All other command needs to be disabled

* htaccess and htpasswd need to be updated for flag directory

* Direct access to xiomara.generator file should generate forbidden error

* Never upload generator.c in main server
